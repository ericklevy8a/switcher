The Switcher Game

Â© Copyright 2019 by Erick Levy

This is a remake of an old simple game coded first in Java for Android, and ported to HTML5, CSS3 and Javacript for my web skills test area.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about and play with this little app.

How to Play

The goal of this game is to TURN ON all the nine switches.

Changing a switch also changes the adjacent switches (top, bottom and sides, not diagonally).

Try to do it without going over nine steps!
